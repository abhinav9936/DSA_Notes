# How to Implement Priority Queue? 
Priority queue can be implemented using the following data structures: 

# Arrays
* Arrays	enqueue()	dequeue()	peek()
* TC	      O(1)	    O(n)	   O(n)
# Linked list
* Linked List	push()	pop()	peek()
* Time Complexity	O(n)	O(1)	O(1)
# Heap data structure
* Look for it's implementation
* Heap              	peek()	insert()	delete()
* Time Complexity	     O(1)	  O(log n)	O(log n)
# Binary search tree
* A Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree like AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc. can also be used to implement a priority queue. Operations like peek(), insert() and delete() can be performed using BST.
* Binary Search Tree	peek()	insert()	delete()
* Time Complexity	     O(1)	  O(log n)	O(log n)
