*  the size of the table must be greater than or equal to the total number of keys
*  Different Probing Techniques
  ** Linear Probing: The function used for rehashing is as follows: rehash(key) = (n+1)%table-size. 
  ** Quadratic Probing : we look for the i2â€˜th slot in the ith iteration.
  ** Double Hashing: [h1(692) + i * (h2(692)] % 7 - i it the ith Probe
